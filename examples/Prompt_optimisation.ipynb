These bears require large areas of wilderness, and their habitats are threatened by development, forestry, mining and oil prospecting, road building, climate change, and increasing recreational use. A knock-on effect of the destruction is increasing fragmentation of brown bear populations and sub-populations, leading to reduced breeding opportunities and a resultant reduction in genetic diversity.'}, {'chunk-uid': 'c7d85714-12fd-4464-9896-fbd4362ff4b8', 'text-content': 'Excluding European Russia there are thought to be around 14,000 brown bears in Europe and excluding Asian Russia there are thought to be around 30,000 in Asia.\\\\n\\\\n![Map showing brown bears in North America](image2.png)\\\\n\\\\nBrown bears in North America (Map supplied by USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center)\\\\n\\\\n![Kodiak brown bear at Frazer Lake Weir](image3.png)\\\\n\\\\nKodiak brown bear (*Ursus arctos middendorffi*) at Frazer Lake Weir, Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska.
