For example, you could guide the language model to expand the query with related keywords, rephrase it to be more specific, or include synonyms to capture a broader range of results.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: Incorporate context-aware revisions by instructing the system to consider the intent behind the user query. This could involve analyzing the keywords used, identifying key topics or entities mentioned, and tailoring the revision process to ensure the retrieved information aligns closely with the user's search intent.\n\n3. **Semantic Enrichment**: Encourage the language model to enrich the user query by adding relevant context or background information. This could involve expanding abbreviations, disambiguating terms, or providing additional context cues to help the system generate more accurate and contextually relevant revisions.\n\n4. **Query Expansion Strategies**: Guide the system to employ query expansion techniques such as adding related terms, synonyms, or concepts to broaden the scope of the search. By expanding the user query intelligently, the system can retrieve more diverse and comprehensive chunks of information that align with the user's information needs.\n\n5. **Optimizing for Information Retrieval**: Direct the system to focus on optimizing the revised query for effective information retrieval.

Their main requirements are dense cover in which to shelter, usually by day, and in cooler regions suitable places in which to build winter dens for hibernation.

The output is used as Output of the string-based function with purpose: Revises the user query using the revisor prompt and then retrieves relevant chunks using the revised query\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The query revisor prompt. This instructs a LLM how to revise the user query for search. This should be completely general and not contain any specific details about the user query, only how to modify the query for search. in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>The current query revisor prompt \"do something\" is quite vague and doesn't provide specific guidance on how to revise the user query effectively for search. To enhance the system's performance and align with the feedback provided, consider the following improvements:\n\n1. **Specific Revision Instructions**: Instead of a generic directive like \"do something,\" provide clear and specific instructions on how the user query should be revised. For example, you could guide the language model to expand the query with related keywords, rephrase it to be more specific, or include synonyms to capture a broader range of results.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding**: Incorporate context-aware revisions by instructing the system to consider the intent behind the user query. This could involve analyzing the keywords used, identifying key topics or entities mentioned, and tailoring the revision process to ensure the retrieved information aligns closely with the user's search intent.\n\n3. **Semantic Enrichment**: Encourage the language model to enrich the user query by adding relevant context or background information. This could involve expanding abbreviations, disambiguating terms, or providing additional context cues to help the system generate more accurate and contextually relevant revisions.\n\n4. **Query Expansion Strategies**: Guide the system to employ query expansion techniques such as adding related terms, synonyms, or concepts to broaden the scope of the search. By expanding the user query intelligently, the system can retrieve more diverse and comprehensive chunks of information that align with the user's information needs.\n\n5. **Optimizing for Information Retrieval**: Direct the system to focus on optimizing the revised query for effective information retrieval. This could involve structuring the query to target specific types of information sources, refining the language to match the content of interest, or tailoring the query to extract detailed and relevant chunks from a wide range of sources.\n\nBy implementing these enhancements in the query revisor prompt, the system can better guide the language model in revising user queries for search, leading to more comprehensive, accurate, and engaging information retrieval experiences for users.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The query revisor prompt.
