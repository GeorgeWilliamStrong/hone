For instance, if the user query is about bears, the prompt could be revised to something like \"Refine a search query about the habitat of bears.\"\n\n2. **Include Key Details**: Incorporate key details or keywords from the user query into the prompt to guide the system in generating a more focused query. For example, if the user query is \"where do bears live,\" the prompt could be adjusted to \"Enhance a search query about the natural habitats of bears.\"\n\n3. **Encourage Specificity**: Encourage the system to generate specific and targeted queries that directly address the user's information needs. For instance, the prompt could guide the system to ask questions like \"What are the specific locations where brown bears can be found?\" or \"Describe the typical habitats of brown bears.\"\n\n4. **Consider User Intent**: Prompt the system to consider the underlying intent of the user query beyond just keyword matching. Encourage the system to understand the context and semantics of the query to provide more relevant and accurate information.\n\n5. **Diversify Query Patterns**: Introduce variations in the prompt to explore different angles of the user query. This can help in generating a range of revised queries that cover various aspects of the user's information needs.\n\nBy implementing these improvements in the query revisor prompt, the system can generate more targeted and contextually relevant queries, leading to the retrieval of chunks that better align with the user's search intent and improve the overall search experience.",

It seems likely that increasing encroachment by humans has caused brown bears to favour wooded and semi-wooded habitats whereas historically they would have favoured open or semi-open country at least as much.\\n### DIET'}, {'chunk-uid': 'c0d40c18-df79-41f9-8e68-2d48b0580b25', 'source-file-name': 'Brown_bear_factsheet.pdf', 'similarity-score': 0.5350634, 'text-content': 'For more specific descriptions of habitat, diet, and life cycle, please refer to the individual pages for each subspecies of brown bear and to the reading list.\\n\\n### CURRENT SITUATION\\n\\nProbably the single greatest threat to the brown bear populations of the world is habitat loss. These bears require large areas of wilderness, and their habitats are threatened by development, forestry, mining and oil prospecting, road building, climate change, and increasing recreational use. A knock-on effect of the destruction is increasing fragmentation of brown bear populations and sub-populations, leading to reduced breeding opportunities and a resultant reduction in genetic diversity.'}, {'chunk-uid': 'f5bcc2a9-087a-484e-9f55-5179698a0af9', 'source-file-name': 'Brown_bear_factsheet.pdf', 'similarity-score': 0.5313473, 'text-content': '### CONSERVATION\\n\\nWhilst some individual populations of brown bears face conservation issues unique to them, there are a number of critical factors which are common to all:\\n\\n- Habitat destruction and fragmentation\\n- Conflicts with humans (predominantly food-related)\\n- Poaching (coupled in some populations with unsustainable levels of hunting)\\n- Climate change and its effect upon the ecology of bear habitat\\n\\nBelow we detail some of the initiatives already taking place, together with those additionally required, to ameliorate these issues.\\n\\n#### Habitat protection and restoration'}] </OUTPUT_OF_FUNCTION>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as Output of the string-based function with purpose: Revise the user query using revisor prompt and retrieve relevant chunks using revised query\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The query revisor prompt. This should not be specific, but rather instructs a LLM to make the provided user query better for search in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>The current prompt \"make a search query\" is quite generic and lacks specificity, which can lead to the retrieval of irrelevant information as seen in the evaluation feedback. To improve the effectiveness of the query revisor prompt and address the feedback provided, consider the following enhancements:\n\n1. **Add Contextual Information**: Instead of a generic prompt, provide context to the system about the specific topic or subject of the user query. For instance, if the user query is about bears, the prompt could be revised to something like \"Refine a search query about the habitat of bears.\"\n\n2. **Include Key Details**: Incorporate key details or keywords from the user query into the prompt to guide the system in generating a more focused query. For example, if the user query is \"where do bears live,\" the prompt could be adjusted to \"Enhance a search query about the natural habitats of bears.\"\n\n3. **Encourage Specificity**: Encourage the system to generate specific and targeted queries that directly address the user's information needs. For instance, the prompt could guide the system to ask questions like \"What are the specific locations where brown bears can be found?\" or \"Describe the typical habitats of brown bears.\"\n\n4. **Consider User Intent**: Prompt the system to consider the underlying intent of the user query beyond just keyword matching. Encourage the system to understand the context and semantics of the query to provide more relevant and accurate information.\n\n5. **Diversify Query Patterns**: Introduce variations in the prompt to explore different angles of the user query. This can help in generating a range of revised queries that cover various aspects of the user's information needs.\n\nBy implementing these improvements in the query revisor prompt, the system can generate more targeted and contextually relevant queries, leading to the retrieval of chunks that better align with the user's search intent and improve the overall search experience.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The query revisor prompt. This should not be specific, but rather instructs a LLM to make the provided user query better for search) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.",
