    "_backward_through_string_fn": "The current query revisor prompt \"do something\" is very vague and lacks specificity, which can lead to suboptimal query revisions and subsequently impact the relevance of the retrieved chunks. To address this and improve the system based on the feedback received, consider the following enhancements:\n\n1. **Contextual Relevance**: Instead of a generic phrase like \"do something,\" provide specific instructions or guidelines on how to revise the user query. For example, you could guide the language model to focus on key aspects such as habitat, diet, behavior, population, or conservation efforts related to bears. This will help the system generate more targeted and relevant query revisions.\n\n2. **Semantic Understanding**: Encourage the language model to not only revise the query based on keywords but also to understand the context and intent behind the user query. By incorporating semantic analysis and context awareness, the system can offer more nuanced and accurate query revisions that align with the user's information needs.\n\n3. **Query Expansion**: Prompt the language model to expand the user query by including related terms, synonyms, or broader concepts to ensure a comprehensive search. This expansion can help capture a wider range of relevant information and improve the overall depth of the retrieved chunks.\n\n4. **User Intent Alignment**: Guide the system to revise the query in a way that directly addresses the user's intent or question. By aligning the revised query with the user's underlying purpose, the system can deliver more precise and valuable chunks of information that meet the user's expectations.\n\n5. **Feedback Loop Integration**: Consider incorporating a feedback loop mechanism where the relevance of the retrieved chunks is used to refine and improve the query revisor prompt iteratively. By analyzing the quality of the retrieved information, the system can learn to generate more effective query revisions over time.\n\nBy implementing these improvements in the query revisor prompt, you can enhance the system's ability to generate relevant and informative query revisions, ultimately leading to a more engaging and enriching user experience when exploring bear habitats.",

Dozens of bears may gather to feed on the fish to rapidly build up energy stores for their winter hibernation and they will eat as much as 40 kilograms of food each day.\\n\\nThe bears build winter dens for their hibernation and may lose as much as fifty percent of their body weight whilst hibernating. Pregnant females give birth during hibernation, in the den, usually to a pair of cubs. The cubs will remain with their mother for about two and a half years, during which time she will not become pregnant again.\\n\\n1 Brown Bear Fact Sheet [www.bearconservation.org.uk](http://www.bearconservation.org.uk) Working for Bears Worldwide'}, {'chunk-uid': '5e387e93-6b6d-4327-b316-44d493b05fa7', 'source-file-name': 'Brown_bear_factsheet.pdf', 'similarity-score': 0.6175617, 'text-content': '2 Brown Bear Fact Sheet [www.bearconservation.org.uk](http://www.bearconservation.org.uk) Working for Bears Worldwide\\n\\n## RANGE\\n\\nBrown bears are found in Afghanistan, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan (possibly extinct), Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Greece, India, Iraq, Iran, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mongolia, Montenegro, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United States (principally Alaska), and Uzbekistan.

They are found from as high as 5,000 metres in the Himalaya down to sea-level in a number of regions. They survive successfully in icy conditions and deserts, in forests and on tundra, in meadows and on coastlines. Their main requirements are dense cover in which to shelter, usually by day, and in cooler regions suitable places in which to build winter dens for hibernation. It seems likely that increasing encroachment by humans has caused brown bears to favour wooded and semi-wooded habitats whereas historically they would have favoured open or semi-open country at least as much.\\n### DIET'}, {'chunk-uid': '7a19a4a0-c096-4490-a382-c972d5630cc2', 'source-file-name': 'Brown_bear_factsheet.pdf', 'similarity-score': 0.6072573, 'text-content': '# Species Factsheet 2: Brown bear (Ursus arctos)\\n\\n![Brown bear in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska (Steve Hillebrand/USFWS)](https://www.bearconservation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brown-bear-in-the-Kodiak-National-Wildlife-Refuge-in-Alaska-Steve-Hillebrand-USFWS.jpg)\\n\\n## OVERVIEW\\n\\nThe brown bear is the most widely distributed of all bears and is widespread in the forests and mountains of North America, Europe, and Asia with a relatively large global population that is currently stable.

The output is used as Output of the string-based function with purpose: Revises the user query using the revisor prompt and then retrieves relevant chunks using the revised query\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The query revisor prompt. This instructs a LLM how to revise the user query for search. This should be completely general and not contain any specific details about the user query, only how to modify the query for search. in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>The current query revisor prompt \"do something\" is very vague and lacks specificity, which can lead to suboptimal query revisions and subsequently impact the relevance of the retrieved chunks. To address this and improve the system based on the feedback received, consider the following enhancements:\n\n1. **Contextual Relevance**: Instead of a generic phrase like \"do something,\" provide specific instructions or guidelines on how to revise the user query. For example, you could guide the language model to focus on key aspects such as habitat, diet, behavior, population, or conservation efforts related to bears. This will help the system generate more targeted and relevant query revisions.\n\n2. **Semantic Understanding**: Encourage the language model to not only revise the query based on keywords but also to understand the context and intent behind the user query. By incorporating semantic analysis and context awareness, the system can offer more nuanced and accurate query revisions that align with the user's information needs.\n\n3. **Query Expansion**: Prompt the language model to expand the user query by including related terms, synonyms, or broader concepts to ensure a comprehensive search. This expansion can help capture a wider range of relevant information and improve the overall depth of the retrieved chunks.\n\n4. **User Intent Alignment**: Guide the system to revise the query in a way that directly addresses the user's intent or question. By aligning the revised query with the user's underlying purpose, the system can deliver more precise and valuable chunks of information that meet the user's expectations.\n\n5. **Feedback Loop Integration**: Consider incorporating a feedback loop mechanism where the relevance of the retrieved chunks is used to refine and improve the query revisor prompt iteratively. By analyzing the quality of the retrieved information, the system can learn to generate more effective query revisions over time.\n\nBy implementing these improvements in the query revisor prompt, you can enhance the system's ability to generate relevant and informative query revisions, ultimately leading to a more engaging and enriching user experience when exploring bear habitats.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The query revisor prompt.
