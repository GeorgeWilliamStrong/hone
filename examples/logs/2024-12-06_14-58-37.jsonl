To improve the relevance of the retrieved chunks to the user query, consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Revising User Query**: The user query \"where do bears live?\" is quite specific and prompts a direct answer about the habitats of bears. To enhance relevance, the revised query could be more explicit and focused, such as \"What are the natural habitats of brown bears?\" or \"Describe the typical living environments of bears.\"\n\n2. **Revising Chunk Selection Criteria**: When retrieving chunks based on the revised query, ensure that the selection criteria prioritize information directly related to bear habitats. Look for chunks that specifically discuss the geographical locations, ecosystems, and characteristics of bear habitats rather than broader topics like conservation efforts or bear behavior.\n\n3. **Utilizing Key Terms**: Incorporate key terms related to bear habitats in the revisor prompt to guide the selection of relevant chunks. Terms like \"natural habitat,\" \"geographical range,\" \"ecosystem,\" or specific bear species names can help narrow down the focus of the retrieved information.\n\n4. **Contextual Understanding**: Improve the string-based function's contextual understanding to distinguish between general information about bears and specific details about their habitats. This can help in filtering out chunks that are more tangential to the user query.\n\n5. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop mechanism where the system can learn from previous evaluations to continuously improve the relevance of retrieved chunks. By analyzing past discrepancies between user queries and retrieved information, the system can adapt and enhance its performance over time.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system can better align the retrieved chunks with the user query, providing more relevant and accurate information about where bears live.",

In Latin and Greek respectively both names mean \u201cbear\u201d; so the brown bear is the BEAR BEAR. They are a large bear and have long, thick, fur with a distinct mane at the back of the neck. They have large, curved claws. The pelage varies from almost white through to almost black although brown predominates and Indian brown bears can be reddish. The United States subspecies U. arctos horribilis takes its common name of the grizzly bear from the often grey or white tipped fur which gives them a grizzled appearance.\\n\\n![Brown bear, Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska (US Fish & Wildlife Service - Steve Hillebrand)](https://www.bearconservation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Brown-bear-Kodiak-National-Wildlife-Refuge-Alaska-US-Fish-Wildlife-Service-Steve-Hillebrand.jpg)'}, {'chunk-uid': '7096efb8-ee57-48f7-b56a-b41cf980f3f5', 'source-file-name': 'Brown_bear_factsheet.pdf', 'similarity-score': 0.5475026, 'text-content': '![Map showing brown bears in Europe](image4.png)\\n\\nBrown bears in Europe (Map supplied by the European Commission)\\n\\n**HABITAT**\\n\\n*Ursus arctos* inhabits a broader and more diverse range of habitats than any other bear species. They are found from as high as 5,000 metres in the Himalaya down to sea-level in a number of regions. They survive successfully in icy conditions and deserts, in forests and on tundra, in meadows and on coastlines. Their main requirements are dense cover in which to shelter, usually by day, and in cooler regions suitable places in which to build winter dens for hibernation. It seems likely that increasing encroachment by humans has caused brown bears to favour wooded and semi-wooded habitats whereas historically they would have favoured open or semi-open country at least as much.\\n### DIET'}, {'chunk-uid': 'c0d40c18-df79-41f9-8e68-2d48b0580b25', 'text-content': 'For more specific descriptions of habitat, diet, and life cycle, please refer to the individual pages for each subspecies of brown bear and to the reading list.\\n\\n### CURRENT SITUATION\\n\\nProbably the single greatest threat to the brown bear populations of the world is habitat loss. These bears require large areas of wilderness, and their habitats are threatened by development, forestry, mining and oil prospecting, road building, climate change, and increasing recreational use. A knock-on effect of the destruction is increasing fragmentation of brown bear populations and sub-populations, leading to reduced breeding opportunities and a resultant reduction in genetic diversity.', 'similarity-score': 0.5350634, 'source-file-name': 'Brown_bear_factsheet.pdf'}, {'chunk-uid': 'f5bcc2a9-087a-484e-9f55-5179698a0af9', 'source-file-name': 'Brown_bear_factsheet.pdf', 'similarity-score': 0.5313473, 'text-content': '### CONSERVATION\\n\\nWhilst some individual populations of brown bears face conservation issues unique to them, there are a number of critical factors which are common to all:\\n\\n- Habitat destruction and fragmentation\\n- Conflicts with humans (predominantly food-related)\\n- Poaching (coupled in some populations with unsustainable levels of hunting)\\n- Climate change and its effect upon the ecology of bear habitat\\n\\nBelow we detail some of the initiatives already taking place, together with those additionally required, to ameliorate these issues.\\n\\n#### Habitat protection and restoration'}] </OUTPUT_OF_FUNCTION>\n\n</CONVERSATION>\n\nThis conversation is potentially part of a larger system. The output is used as Output of the string-based function with purpose: Revise the user query using revisor prompt and retrieve relevant chunks using revised query\n\nHere is the feedback we got for The query revisor prompt. This should be completely general and not specific to the user query. in the conversation:\n\n<FEEDBACK>The current prompt \"make a search query\" is quite generic and lacks specificity to guide the system in revising the user query effectively for retrieving relevant chunks. To enhance the performance of the system and address the feedback provided, consider the following improvements:\n\n1. **Contextual Clarity**: Instead of a broad instruction like \"make a search query,\" provide more context-specific guidance to the system. For example, you could prompt the system with instructions like \"Refine the user query to focus on bear habitats\" or \"Craft a query that specifically targets the natural living environments of bears.\"\n\n2. **Focus on User Intent**: Encourage the system to understand the user's intent better by prompting it with queries that align with the user's information needs. For instance, prompts such as \"Clarify where bears reside in the wild\" or \"Seek information on bear habitats\" can guide the system towards retrieving more relevant chunks.\n\n3. **Incorporate Key Terms**: Integrate key terms related to bear habitats directly into the prompt to guide the system's query revision process. Terms like \"natural habitat,\" \"geographical range,\" \"ecosystem,\" or specific bear species names can help the system narrow down its focus and improve the selection of chunks related to bear habitats.\n\n4. **Encourage Specificity**: Encourage the system to be more specific in revising the user query by prompting it with detailed instructions. For example, prompts like \"Focus on geographical locations where bears live\" or \"Highlight the typical habitats of brown bears\" can guide the system towards retrieving more precise and relevant information.\n\n5. **Feedback Integration**: Encourage the system to learn from past evaluations by incorporating a feedback loop mechanism directly into the prompt. Prompt the system to analyze past discrepancies and adjust its query revision process accordingly to continuously improve the relevance of retrieved chunks over time.\n\nBy implementing these enhancements in the query revisor prompt, the system can better align the revised user query with the user's information needs, ultimately improving the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved chunks related to bear habitats.</FEEDBACK>\n\n</CONTEXT>\n\nImprove the variable (The query revisor prompt. This should be completely general and not specific to the user query.) using the feedback provided in <FEEDBACK> tags.\nSend the improved variable in the following format:\n\n<IMPROVED_VARIABLE>{the improved variable}</IMPROVED_VARIABLE>\n\nSend ONLY the improved variable between the <IMPROVED_VARIABLE> tags, and nothing else.",
