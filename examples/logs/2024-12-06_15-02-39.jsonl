For instance, \"Evaluate how relevant the retrieved chunks are to the user query, highlighting both the strengths and any gaps in the information provided.\"\n\n4. **Include Specificity in Feedback**: The prompt could ask for specific feedback on each chunk's relevance, which would help in identifying which chunks are most useful. For example, \"Evaluate how relevant each retrieved chunk is to the user query, providing specific feedback on the relevance of geographic and habitat information.\"\n\n5. **Address Potential Bias**: The prompt could address potential biases in the retrieved information, such as focusing on a single species. For instance, \"Evaluate how relevant the retrieved chunks are to the user query, considering any biases towards specific bear species and how this affects the overall relevance.\"\n\n6. **Encourage Contextual Understanding**: The prompt could encourage evaluators to consider the context of the user query.

Here is a breakdown of the relevance:\n\n1. **Chunk 2 (43559da2-acc7-428b-9ca2-333b07315011)**: This chunk provides information about the principal range of brown bears, mentioning specific regions such as parts of Russia, the United States, Canada, and several European countries. This directly addresses the query by listing where brown bears live.\n\n2. **Chunk 3 (5e387e93-6b6d-4327-b316-44d493b05fa7)**: This chunk expands on the range of brown bears, listing numerous countries across Europe, Asia, and North America. It highlights the wide distribution of brown bears, which is relevant to understanding where bears live globally.\n\n3. **Chunk 4 (7096efb8-ee57-48f7-b56a-b41cf980f3f5)**: This chunk discusses the diverse habitats of brown bears, from high altitudes in the Himalayas to sea-level regions, and their adaptability to various environments. This information is relevant as it provides insight into the types of habitats bears can occupy.\n\n4. **Chunk 5 (7a19a4a0-c096-4490-a382-c972d5630cc2)**: This chunk reiterates the widespread distribution of brown bears in North America, Europe, and Asia, which is pertinent to the query about bear habitats.\n\n5. **Chunk 6 (c7d85714-12fd-4464-9896-fbd4362ff4b8)**: This chunk provides population estimates and maps showing the distribution of brown bears in Europe and North America, which indirectly relates to where bears live by indicating their population density in these regions.\n\nOverall, while the information is specific to brown bears, it provides a comprehensive overview of their habitats and distribution, which is relevant to the user's query about where bears live. However, it does not cover other bear species, which might be a limitation if the user is interested in a broader scope. </LM_OUTPUT>\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback and criticism to the variable given the above evaluation output.

For instance, if the query is revised to include specific habitats or regions, the system should prioritize chunks that directly address these aspects. Implementing a more sophisticated natural language understanding model could help in achieving this.\n\n6. **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**: Implement a feedback mechanism where users can rate the relevance of the retrieved information. This feedback can be used to continuously refine the query revision and retrieval process, ensuring that future queries yield more relevant results.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the system can improve the relevance of the retrieved information to better align with the user's query and the objective function..\nHere is the combined feedback we got for this specific Output of the string-based function with purpose: Revises the user query using the revisor prompt and then retrieves relevant chunks using the revised query and other variables: To improve the relevance of the retrieved information to the user query \"where do bears live?\", consider the following feedback:\n\n1. **Query Revision for Specificity**: The user query \"where do bears live?\" is quite broad and could be interpreted in various ways. The revisor prompt could be enhanced to refine the query by specifying the type of bears or the geographical scope of interest. For example, revising the query to \"where do all species of bears live?\" or \"where do bears live globally?\" could help in retrieving more comprehensive information that includes multiple bear species, not just brown bears.\n\n2. **Inclusion of Other Bear Species**: The retrieved information is heavily focused on brown bears. To improve relevance, the retrieval process should ensure that information about other bear species, such as polar bears, black bears, and panda bears, is also included. This could be achieved by expanding the search criteria or using a more diverse dataset that covers various bear species.\n\n3. **Diverse Source Files**: The retrieved chunks are all from the same source file, \"Brown_bear_factsheet.pdf\". To enhance the diversity and relevance of the information, the retrieval system could be adjusted to pull data from multiple sources or documents that cover different aspects of bear habitats and distributions.\n\n4. **Similarity Score Threshold**: The similarity scores of the retrieved chunks range from 0.597 to 0.661. To improve the relevance, consider adjusting the threshold for similarity scores to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved. This might involve fine-tuning the similarity scoring algorithm to better capture the nuances of the query.\n\n5. **Contextual Understanding**: The retrieval system could benefit from a deeper contextual understanding of the query. For instance, if the query is revised to include specific habitats or regions, the system should prioritize chunks that directly address these aspects. Implementing a more sophisticated natural language understanding model could help in achieving this.\n\n6. **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**: Implement a feedback mechanism where users can rate the relevance of the retrieved information. This feedback can be used to continuously refine the query revision and retrieval process, ensuring that future queries yield more relevant results.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the system can improve the relevance of the retrieved information to better align with the user's query and the objective function.. </OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>\n\nWe are interested in giving feedback to the The query revisor prompt.
