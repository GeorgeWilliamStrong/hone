    "_backward_through_llm": "To optimize the performance of the variable in question, which involves revising the user query and retrieving relevant information chunks, several improvements can be suggested based on the evaluation output provided:\n\n1. **Refinement of Query Revision Strategy**:\n   - The initial user query \"where do bears live?\" is broad and could be interpreted in various ways. The revisor prompt could be optimized to refine the query to target more specific aspects of bear habitats, such as \"List the geographical regions where brown bears are found.\" This would help in retrieving more focused chunks directly relevant to geographical locations rather than broader topics like diet or social behavior.\n\n2. **Enhancement of Retrieval Algorithm**:\n   - The retrieval function seems to fetch chunks based on keyword matching but may benefit from a more sophisticated understanding of context and relevance. Implementing or enhancing natural language understanding capabilities could help prioritize chunks that directly answer the geographical aspect of the query. For instance, using vector-based similarity measures that consider semantic meaning rather than just keyword overlap could improve the relevance of retrieved chunks.\n\n3. **Adjustment of Similarity Scoring**:\n   - The similarity scores provided with each chunk indicate how closely the content is believed to match the query. However, the evaluation suggests that some chunks with relatively high similarity scores (like the one discussing bear diet) are not very relevant. Reviewing and recalibrating the criteria or algorithm used to calculate these scores could help in better aligning them with actual content relevance, particularly focusing on geographical data when the query pertains to locations.\n\n4. **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**:\n   - Implementing a feedback mechanism where the relevance of retrieved chunks can be rated by users or reviewers could provide valuable data for continuously training and improving the query revision and information retrieval processes. This data can be used to fine-tune both the revisor prompts and the retrieval algorithms.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Geographic Filters**:\n   - Since the query specifically asks for locations, the system could be improved by integrating geographic filters or tags that prioritize chunks containing names of places, maps, or explicit mentions of habitats. This would directly enhance the relevance of the retrieved information to the user's query.\n\n6. **User Query Clarification Prompt**:\n   - Before finalizing the query revision, the system could prompt the user to clarify or specify their query further based on common follow-up questions. For example, if a user asks \"where do bears live?\", the system might ask \"Do you want to know about specific types of bears or bear habitats in general?\" This interactive approach could refine the query more effectively and lead to more satisfactory retrieval results.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the system can be better aligned with the objective of retrieving highly relevant information chunks in response to user queries, particularly improving the accuracy and relevance of the information provided in relation to geographic details of animal habitats.",

    "_backward_through_llm": "The current system prompt \"<VARIABLE> Evaluate how relevant the retrieved chunks are to the user query. </VARIABLE>\" effectively directs the language model to assess the relevance of information chunks to a specific user query. However, there are several ways this prompt could be enhanced to improve the precision and depth of the evaluation, aligning more closely with the <OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>.\n\n1. **Specify the Criteria for Relevance**: The prompt could be more explicit about the criteria that define \"relevance.\" This would guide the language model to not only state whether the information is relevant but also to consider specific aspects such as geographical accuracy, detail level, and directness of the answer to the user's query. For example, changing the prompt to \"Evaluate how directly and comprehensively the retrieved chunks answer the user query regarding geographic locations.\"\n\n2. **Incorporate a Request for Justification**: Adding a requirement for the model to justify its relevance assessment could lead to more thoughtful and detailed evaluations. This could involve explaining why certain chunks are considered highly relevant while others are not, based on the content's directness in answering the query or the richness of the information provided. For instance, the prompt could be, \"Evaluate and justify the relevance of each retrieved chunk in relation to the user's query about geographic locations.\"\n\n3. **Encourage Comparative Analysis**: The prompt could encourage the model to compare chunks against each other to establish a benchmark of relevance. This would help in ranking the chunks more effectively according to their utility in answering the user's query. A revised prompt might read, \"Evaluate the relevance of the retrieved chunks to the user query by comparing their directness and comprehensiveness in answering the geographic aspects of the query.\"\n\n4. **Prompt for Contextual Relevance**: The prompt could also include a directive to assess the contextual relevance of the information. This means evaluating whether the information is not only factually correct but also contextually suitable for the user's needs (e.g., current vs. historical range, focusing on specific regions if implied by the query). An enhanced prompt could be, \"Evaluate how relevant and contextually appropriate the retrieved chunks are to the user's query, focusing on current geographical distributions.\"\n\n5. **Highlight the Importance of Source Credibility**: While not directly related to the content of the chunks, understanding the credibility of the source could enhance the relevance evaluation. The prompt could be expanded to include, \"Evaluate the relevance of the retrieved chunks to the user query, considering both the directness of the information and the credibility of the sources.\"\n\nBy refining the system prompt to include these elements, the evaluations produced by the language model are likely to be more detailed, nuanced, and useful in determining the relevance of information chunks to specific user queries, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the system in line with the <OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>.",

The <OUTPUT_OF_FUNCTION> was later used as Output of the string-based function with purpose: Revises the user query using the revisor prompt and then retrieves relevant chunks using the revised query.\n\n<OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>Your goal is to give feedback to the variable to address the following feedback on the OUTPUT_OF_FUNCTION: Here is the combined feedback we got for this specific Output of the string-based function with purpose: Revises the user query using the revisor prompt and then retrieves relevant chunks using the revised query and other variables: To optimize the performance of the variable in question, which involves revising the user query and retrieving relevant information chunks, several improvements can be suggested based on the evaluation output provided:\n\n1. **Refinement of Query Revision Strategy**:\n   - The initial user query \"where do bears live?\" is broad and could be interpreted in various ways. The revisor prompt could be optimized to refine the query to target more specific aspects of bear habitats, such as \"List the geographical regions where brown bears are found.\" This would help in retrieving more focused chunks directly relevant to geographical locations rather than broader topics like diet or social behavior.\n\n2. **Enhancement of Retrieval Algorithm**:\n   - The retrieval function seems to fetch chunks based on keyword matching but may benefit from a more sophisticated understanding of context and relevance. Implementing or enhancing natural language understanding capabilities could help prioritize chunks that directly answer the geographical aspect of the query. For instance, using vector-based similarity measures that consider semantic meaning rather than just keyword overlap could improve the relevance of retrieved chunks.\n\n3. **Adjustment of Similarity Scoring**:\n   - The similarity scores provided with each chunk indicate how closely the content is believed to match the query. However, the evaluation suggests that some chunks with relatively high similarity scores (like the one discussing bear diet) are not very relevant. Reviewing and recalibrating the criteria or algorithm used to calculate these scores could help in better aligning them with actual content relevance, particularly focusing on geographical data when the query pertains to locations.\n\n4. **Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement**:\n   - Implementing a feedback mechanism where the relevance of retrieved chunks can be rated by users or reviewers could provide valuable data for continuously training and improving the query revision and information retrieval processes. This data can be used to fine-tune both the revisor prompts and the retrieval algorithms.\n\n5. **Inclusion of Geographic Filters**:\n   - Since the query specifically asks for locations, the system could be improved by integrating geographic filters or tags that prioritize chunks containing names of places, maps, or explicit mentions of habitats. This would directly enhance the relevance of the retrieved information to the user's query.\n\n6. **User Query Clarification Prompt**:\n   - Before finalizing the query revision, the system could prompt the user to clarify or specify their query further based on common follow-up questions. For example, if a user asks \"where do bears live?\", the system might ask \"Do you want to know about specific types of bears or bear habitats in general?\" This interactive approach could refine the query more effectively and lead to more satisfactory retrieval results.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, the system can be better aligned with the objective of retrieving highly relevant information chunks in response to user queries, particularly improving the accuracy and relevance of the information provided in relation to geographic details of animal habitats..\nHere is the combined feedback we got for this specific Output of the string-based function with purpose: Revises the user query using the revisor prompt and then retrieves relevant chunks using the revised query and other variables: To optimize the performance of the variable in question, which involves revising the user query and retrieving relevant information chunks, several improvements can be suggested based on the evaluation output provided:\n\n1. **Refinement of Query Revision Strategy**:\n   - The initial user query \"where do bears live?\" is broad and could be interpreted in various ways.

To align better with the <OBJECTIVE_FUNCTION>, the variable needs substantial refinement to provide clear, actionable instructions to the language model. Here are several strategies for improvement:\n\n1. **Incorporate Specific Instructional Keywords**: The revisor prompt should include specific action verbs that guide the language model in how to modify the query. For example, using terms like \"specify,\" \"expand,\" \"focus,\" or \"clarify\" can direct the model to adjust the query in a more targeted manner.\n\n2. **Guidance on Query Focus**: The prompt should instruct the model to identify and focus on the key elements of the user query that are most relevant to the search intent. In the case of geographical information about bear habitats, the prompt could guide the model to emphasize location-based terms and phrases.\n\n3. **Encourage the Use of Synonyms and Related Terms**: To enhance the breadth and relevance of the search, the prompt could instruct the model to include synonyms and closely related terms in the revised query. This would help in capturing a wider array of relevant documents that might use different terminologies.\n\n4. **Contextual Understanding Emphasis**: The prompt should encourage the model to consider the context of the query.

This could involve instructing the model to strip out unnecessary details and focus on the core query components.\n\n6. **Adaptability to Query Type**: The prompt should be adaptable to different types of queries, whether they are seeking definitions, explanations, comparisons, or specific data points. This adaptability can be achieved by instructing the model to first classify the type of query and then apply the most suitable revision strategy.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the revisor prompt can become a more effective tool in guiding the language model to produce revised queries that are better aligned with the user's search intent, thereby improving the relevance and accuracy of the information retrieved.
