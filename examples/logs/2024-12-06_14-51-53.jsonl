To make it more specific and guide the retrieval of relevant information, consider adding details such as a specific type of bear (e.g., brown bears, polar bears) or a geographical location (e.g., North America, Europe).\n\n2. **Revising the Retrieval Process**: Ensure that the string-based function used to retrieve information is tuned to prioritize locations and habitats of bears based on the revised user query. This can involve adjusting the search parameters or keywords used in the retrieval process.\n\n3. **Enhancing Relevance**: Focus on retrieving chunks that specifically mention the habitats, geographical locations, and ecosystems where bears are commonly found. Emphasize information that directly answers the query about where bears live, rather than general information about bear behavior, conservation efforts, or diet.\n\n4. **Contextual Understanding**: Improve the system's ability to understand the context of the user query and retrieve information that aligns more closely with the user's intent. This can involve incorporating contextual clues, such as keywords related to habitat, range, distribution, or geographical terms.\n\n5. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop mechanism where the system can learn from past queries and evaluations to continuously improve the relevance of retrieved information. By analyzing user interactions and feedback, the system can adapt and refine its retrieval process over time.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the system can enhance the relevance of the retrieved chunks to better address the user query and provide more accurate and specific information about where bears live.",

    "_backward_through_llm": "The system prompt could be improved by providing more specific guidance on the expected relevance of the retrieved chunks to the user query. Instead of a general prompt like \"Evaluate how relevant the retrieved chunks are to the user query,\" consider adding criteria or specific aspects that should be covered in the evaluation. For example, you could ask the evaluator to assess whether the retrieved information directly addresses the geographical locations where bears live, their natural habitats, or specific details about bear habitats. This way, the evaluation will be more focused and the feedback provided will be more actionable in terms of improving the relevance of the retrieved chunks to the user query. By adding clarity and specificity to the prompt, you can guide the evaluation process more effectively and ensure that the feedback aligns closely with the desired outcome of relevance to the user query.",
